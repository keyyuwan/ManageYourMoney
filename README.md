# ðŸ’» Project:

This project was built to help people organize their daily finantial transactions. <br /> <br />
You can register the transaction as a income or outcome, adding a category to it (example: food, leisure, work etc). <br /> <br />
I used MirageJS to build a fake API and add some fake data to the application, and made the API calls with Axios.
